## For Developers

### Building the AI Video Asset Marketplace

**Blockchain Integration**:
- **Story Protocol**: This will be the backbone for managing assets and verifying ownership. Think of it as the ledger where all transactions and ownership details are recorded.
- **Smart Contracts**: These are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. They handle transactions, ownership transfers, and usage rights automatically.

**Livepeer Integration**:
- **Video Transcoding**: Livepeer will handle the heavy lifting of converting videos into different formats and resolutions. This ensures videos play smoothly on any device.
- **AI Processing**: Livepeer AI tools can help with tasks like upscaling video quality, adding subtitles, and recognizing objects in videos.

**AI Tools**:
- **Video Generation**: Use AI models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to create videos. These models can generate realistic animations and deepfake videos.
- **Prompt Processing**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) models will interpret and generate video prompts, making it easy for users to create videos from text descriptions.

**Frontend Development**:
- **Marketplace Dashboard**: Build a user-friendly interface where users can browse, buy, and sell AI-generated videos and prompts.
- **Creator Tools**: Provide tools for creators to generate and list their AI videos and prompts.
